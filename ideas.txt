Feature to add: leadership-configurable chain watcher settings + test ping

Right now, chainstart() announces whatever client.chain_watcher thinks the ping role + threshold are, but leadership can’t change them from Discord.

Add these commands:

/chainconfig threshold <seconds> (leadership) — set alert threshold

/chainconfig poll <seconds> (leadership) — set poll interval

/chainconfig pingrole <role> (leadership) — set ping role used when alert fires

/chainconfig channel (leadership) — set the watcher output channel (without restarting)

/chaintest (leadership) — sends a single test alert ping into the configured channel (useful for permissions/role sanity)

/chainwho — show how many users are opted into /pingme in this guild (public or ephemeral; I’ll do ephemeral)

This is “configuration data”, not long-term stats/history, so persisting it in SQLite is totally consistent with your “no long-term retention” rule.
